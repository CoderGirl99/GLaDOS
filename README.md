# GLaDOS

This project will attempt to emulate the functionality of the Genetic Lifeform and Disc Operating System from the Portal games. For obvious reasons, it will not have access to any sort of deadly neurotoxins, but it will otherwise provide access to an employee database, offer secure logins, and perform advanced calculations. Perhaps in the future it will include machine learning and/or artificial intelligence, but for right now it will be a "dumb" program.

Necessary features:
1. Secure login
2. Menu
3. Employee Database
4. Mathematical calculations
5. Data storage
